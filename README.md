Official mobile app of the independent, student-run newspaper of Stanford University. Contributions are welcome!

## Getting Started

- Install packages by running the `yarn` terminal command from the project directory.
  - If you have native iOS code run `npx pod-install`.
- Run `expo start` to start the bundler.
- When prompted by the command line interface, type `i` or `a` to try it on a [valid simulator](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
- Alternatively, scan the QR code and open the project in a React runtime on a physical device:
  - iOS: [Client iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779)
  - Android: [Client Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=blankexample)

## Adding Native Code

This project can be run from a web browser or the Expo client app. You may find that you want to add more native code later on. You can do this by ejecting the project and rebuilding it yourself.

- Run `yarn eject` to create the native projects.
- You can still run your project in the web browser or Expo client after this step. You will not, however, be able to access any new Node modules.

## Release

- Deploy the native app to the App Store and the Play Store with this guide: [Deployment](https://docs.expo.io/distribution/app-stores/).
